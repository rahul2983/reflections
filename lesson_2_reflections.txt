What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initilize a repository you get the message "Initiliazed empty Git Repository in /../../../.git/"

You need to first identify the folder or directory where you want to create the Git Repository then you need type git init command once u are in the directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is between working directory and Git Commit, it enables us to move files which we think are ready for a commit to a diff area. Before we commit if we want to re-analyse about adding or removing certain files we can do that easily in the staging without doing any commits with git reset command
