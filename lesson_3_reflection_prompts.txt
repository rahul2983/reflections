When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When i want to share my project across the internet or if i am working from another computer or with another person or in a team 
    I would need a remote repository instead of keeping my work local. This of course means that I am thinking of using remote repo
    in conjunction with GitHub Repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    We might be working on a team and in different locations. We might be working on different or same aspects of our project 
    and we maynot want any sort of automatin up-to-date in case we are not ready to take in the changes locally on our Git. That
    is why we would prefer to manually pull in changes.
