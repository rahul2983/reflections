When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When i want to share my project across the internet or if i am working from another computer or with another person or in a team 
    I would need a remote repository instead of keeping my work local. This of course means that I am thinking of using remote repo
    in conjunction with GitHub Repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    We might be working on a team and in different locations. We might be working on different or same aspects of our project 
    and we maynot want any sort of automatin up-to-date in case we are not ready to take in the changes locally on our Git. That
    is why we would prefer to manually pull in changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches help you create a copy of your commits on the same repo on your local machine. Clone lets you copy the whole repo
    from GitHub to local or from local to local. Fork lets you create copy of the whole repo on GitHub within GitHub itself. Fork
    is in fact Clone for GitHub. If I decided to work on a new feature then I would use Branch. If I decide to use my project as a
    component in a bigger project then I would use Clone on my machine. I would also use Clone if I am going to use someone's project
    on the internet (GitHub) but I am not going to modify that. If I plan to work with other folks on a project that is already published
    on GitHub then I would use Fork to give the original creator due credit and also propoer feedback

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It helps you in merging conflicts between your local, remote and the GitHub

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would email my project files to the person with whom I want to collaborate. Wait for his feedback and then once i receive the feedback, act upon it. It would be easier if only two of us are working on a project. Then its way simpler to just email back and forth. The harder part in this approach would be collaborating with more than one person. You would get feedback from multiple emails and then sit down and figure out yourself what to merge and what to update etc. Also time required to finish a project would increase without Git and GitHub as I won't be able to proceed with my work without getting feedback.  

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
